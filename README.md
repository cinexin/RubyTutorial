README

This is a compilation of the source code of most of the exercises and practises of the Ruby Tutorial by CodeAcademy.com ( www.codeacademy.com ).

I've organised it in folders like the tutorial, and you can see the code commented for education purposes (I'm a Ruby beginner, and this is intended for beginners)

Hope it's helpful
